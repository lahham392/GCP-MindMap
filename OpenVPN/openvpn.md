# Setup Openvpn Server

## Objective
Some VPN providers offer their customers the option to request a dedicated IP. This means you’ll get a unique, static IP address that’s only used by you but still hides your real IP.
This has several advantages over a shared IP: You’re less likely to be added to a blacklist, also you won’t have to go through as many extra verification processes, you’ll be able to email faster.
A dedicated IP address also comes with some disadvantages. Firstly, it affects your online privacy.
Secondly, it’ll often cost you extra. Even so, a dedicated IP is the perfect solution for many VPN users.
